## Latest Windows native exe
- Latest windows exe build can be found [here](./native-image-items/build-results/anime.exe)
- I am trying to only ever merge completely functional/working native-image code, but no promises this will always work. More automated testing to come, maybe...
- Ideally get versioning setup as well
